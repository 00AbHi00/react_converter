# react_converter
What i found was that whenever we are uploading to jsx format from premade libraries like bootstrap and tailwind we need to substitute class with className, for with htmlFor, change the &lt;br> tags to &lt;br/> tags so instead of updating each time, i found a way to convert plain html code into jsx
